1. Remove the "Assets\Scripts\Propeller.cs" from Propeller GameObject. Make the propeller spin with an animation clip. Hint: Make the animation clip to be in "Legacy" mode.
2. Add to each gate animation to move it in different directions as you like. 		   
    a. Make different animations for each gate.
    b. Stop all animations at the start of the game. Keep the first gate's animation switched on.
    c. When the player (plane) passes the current gate, stop its animation and play the animation to the next gate.
    e. Make the particle system simulation space be "World" for a more epic experience. :)
3. Attach the "Assets/Audio/SpitfireLoop.mp3"  audio clip to the plane. Decrease volume level! (~0.15f)
4. When the player died, change the pitch of the engine sound "smoothly" to 0.1f.
5. Attach "Assets/Audio/Burn.mp3" to all FlameStreams inside the Gates. Stops all audio sources at the start of the game. 
Make the audio source 3D sound and fix the max distance to be 30. Change the settings to hear the sound when the player(plane) is near the flames. 
Link the volume and play the sound when the flames are enabled just like in real life.
    a. When the flames started, "smoothly" increase the volume to 0.5f. When the flames volume is greater than 0, use the "AudioSource.Play()" method.
    b. When the player (plane) passes the current gate, decrease the sound "smoothly" to 0. When the current gate's flames volume is equal to 0, use the "AudioSource.Stop()" method.
HINT: Use the "Assets/Example.mkv" video for more references.
6. [Optional Task] Implement a music player inside the game.
Add your favorite song to the project.
Add a buttons in the UI or/and shortcut key to play/pause/stop the song.
